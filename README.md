# Skills Assessment

This my skills assesment for Apple, Inc.

The goal is demonstrate that I can build a Rails application, and follow some requirements. My intention was not to produce a production worthy application.

There are comments throughout the code to indicate possible strategies that I might discuss with a team when building a bigger corporate/enterprise Rails appication.

## Requirements

- Must be done in Ruby on Rails
- Accept an address as input
- Retrieve forecast data for the given address. This should include, at minimum, the current temperature (Bonus points - Retrieve high/low and/or extended forecast)
- Display the requested forecast details to the user
- Cache the forecast details for 30 minutes for all subsequent requests by zip codes. Display indicator if result is pulled from cache.

## Assumptions

- This project is open to interpretation
- Functionality is a priority over form
- If you get stuck, complete as much as you can

## Submission

- Use a public source code repository (GitHub, etc) to store your code
- Send us the link to your completed code
